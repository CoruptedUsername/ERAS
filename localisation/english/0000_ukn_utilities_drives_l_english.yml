 JUMP_DRIVE_1:0 "Jump Drive"
 JUMP_DRIVE_1_desc:0 "This FTL drive combines advanced subspace manipulation with quantum mechanical technologies. A ship using this drive firstly enters very deep layers of hyperspace, where quantum coherency is extremely low, but not yet dangerous, allowing a wave function anti-collapse of the entire ship to be initiated. The non-localized wave function is then collapsed again at another point in deep-hyperspace, allowing the ship to appear at its destination instantly."
