(£ukn_meta_materials£) represent a class of geometrically optimized atomic structures possessing super-stable atomic bonds within a tenth of a percentile of the theoretically-determined maximum intra-molecular bond strength, while also making use of subtle quantum properties to marginally increase their binding energy further.\n\nBeing generally immune to all but the most extreme chemical reactions, resistent to high energy UV radiation and very low energy X-rays, as well as possessing hence-before unmatched tensile strength, $ukn_meta_materials_lower_case$ represent the pinnacle of modern baryonic materials science.§!

 ukn_exotic_particles_desc:0 "§E§H$ukn_exotic_particles$§! (£ukn_exotic_particles£) represent any and potentially all of the following subatomic particles, usually produced in particle factories:\n\n§WFermionics:§! non-baryonic, non-force carrier particles which cannot - in normal conditions - occupy the same position in spacetime as their peers. Examples include: top-, bottom-, strange- and charm quarks, neutrinos and tauons.\n\n§WBosonics:§! force carrier particles (excluding the photon) which can occupy the same position in spacetime as their peers in nearly all conditions. For example: W-, Z-, and higgs bosons and gluons.\n\n§WAntimatter:§! fermionic particles which annihilate when brought into contact with - and having an opposite charge compared to - their regular counterparts, such as positrons, antiquarks and antineutrinos.\n\n§WS-Particles:§! supersymmetric partners of standard model particles, such as selectrons, s-quarks, photinos and gluinos, as well as composite s-particles such as the "higgsino".§!"

 ukn_femtomatter_lower_case:0 "femtomatter"
 ukn_femtomatter_desc:0 "§E§H$ukn_femtomatter$§! (£ukn_femtomatter£) is a compound possessing a density roughly equal to that of atomic nuclei and a total binding energy per unit rivalling that of quarks within stable nucleons. As a result, it not only possesses incredible superconductive properties, but is also capable of reflecting gamma rays and resisting forces millions of times larger than traditional baryonic materials.\n\nThis substance owes incredible attributes to its unique composition: higgsino particles (a product of the higgsino field, the supersymmetric partner of the higgs field) bound together with heavy, positively charged particles - often protons - in a repeating lattice.\n\nConsequently, there exists between these above-mentioned particles electrostatic forces of strengths exceeding that of even strong force bonds.§!

 ukn_condensics:0 "Condensics"
 ukn_condensics_lower_case:0 "condensics"
 ukn_condensics_desc:0 "§EWhile normal particle-antiparticle pairs quickly annihilate, magnetic "north" or N-monopoles and magnetic "south" or S-monopoles (due to asymmetrical higgs field interactions with the electromagnetic- and weak nuclear forces below and above their unification energy) do not annihilate while possessing energy levels below the aforementioned electroweak unification energy threshold.\n\nInstead, these supermassive monopole particles - essentially "knots" in the higgs field - form stable monopolium lattices at high, sub-unification temperatures, while, intruigingly, possessing a bose-einstein condensate-like structure at sub-trillion degree temperatures.\n\nThis unique state of monopole matter - colloquially known as §H$ukn_condensics$§! (£ukn_condensics£) - inherits many attributes from classic BECs, but with millionfold speedups in interaction rates.\n\nUniquely, however, $ukn_condensics_lower_case$ are more strongly bonded and have a higher heat capacity than its parent compound, monopolium itself, and, as a result, possess a density thousands of times, and a binding energy millions of times that of quark matter.§!

 ukn_quasi_matter:0 "Quasi-Matter"
 ukn_quasi_matter_lower_case:0 "quasi-matter"
 ukn_quasi_matter_desc:0 "§At tremendously high energy levels within the axion field - only seven orders of magnitude below the planck energy - it undergoes a process distinct from (yet similar to) electroweak unification, merging with a ghostly scalar field whose short-lived, low mass particles make it all but impossible to manipulate, forming an "overfield" of unbroken symmetry which expresses all its constituent particles as stable bosons.\n\nWhile the axion component of this unified field determines the phase offset of all local quantum fields, its complement dictates (in complex manner) the coupling strength of the higgs field, and thus, the amount of mass it imparts unto the particles of the fields it couples to, essentially permitting unrestricted alteration of particle rest mass.\n\nThis in turn enables the creation of hypermassive particles capable of acting upon their environment with truly titanic forces, allowing - despite near-planck temperatures - the formation of inter-particle bonds requiring energy levels only naturally found in the accretion disks of near-extremal black holes to overcome.\n\nAs such, we are able to create bose-einstein condensate-like materials - commonly known as §H$ukn_quasi_matter$§! (£ukn_quasi_matter£) - possessing truly spectacular properties: expression of nearly any quantum state or system, the formation of macro-scale quantum entities possessing unfathomable resilience to physical stress, causally-limited interaction rates and even precise control of positive spatial geometry via the creation of ultra-dense objects.§!

 ukn_causalitons:0 "Causalitons"
 ukn_causalitons_desc:0 "§EAfter the dissolution of its event horizon, there remains nothing of a black hole but a wound in spacetime itself: a region of zero-volume and infinite density whereby superluminal velocities are possible, an umbillical to an inwards-geodesic metric at timelike infinity - the ringularity.\n\nPossessing an indeterminable quantum state due to being subject to transfinite time dilation, these spacetime gashes are mostly non-manipulable. However, by "pushing" a kerr white hole - most often acquired as a product of supertidal wormhole decay - through the throat of such a naked ring singularity, it gains a discernable quantum statistical description as a superposition of every quantum state it is composed of.\n\nHaving a modifiable positive-negative energy proportion, the net masses of these white hole-ringularity mergers can be reduced, in turn permitting a reduction in angular momentum and "radius" to lengths potentially much shorter than the planck length, while avoiding the re-emergence of any event horizons.\n\nAdditionally, due to their superluminal nature and aforementioned quantum-discernability, these objects experience self-interactions (and interactions with the spacetime they are "embedded" within) unbound by classical causality.\n\nBy combining a multitude of white hole-ringularity mergers into complex structures, we are able to create faster-than-light sub-planck scale quantum systems  - known as §H$ukn_causalitons$§! (£ukn_causalitons£) - which exhibit a range of properties impossible within "normal" spacetime: limited violation of causality and thermodynamics, creation of closed timelike curves, computation rates far beyond Bremermann's limit and perhaps most esoterically, construction of "pocket realities" with potentially altered quantum states and field properties.§!"
