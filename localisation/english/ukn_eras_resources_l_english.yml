 ukn_meta_materials_desc:0 "§E§H$ukn_meta_materials$§! (£ukn_meta_materials£) represent a class of geometrically optimized atomic structures possessing super-stable atomic bonds within a tenth of a percentile of the theoretically-determined maximum intra-molecular bond strength, while also making use of subtle quantum properties to marginally increase their binding energy further.\n\nBeing generally immune to all but the most extreme chemical reactions, resistent to high energy UV radiation and very low energy X-rays, as well as possessing hence-before unmatched tensile strength, $ukn_meta_materials_lower_case$ represent the pinnacle of modern baryonic materials science.§!

 ukn_femtomatter_lower_case:0 "femtomatter"
 ukn_femtomatter_desc:0 "§E§H$ukn_femtomatter$§! (£ukn_femtomatter£) is a compound possessing a density roughly equal to that of atomic nuclei and a total binding energy per unit rivalling that of quarks within stable nucleons. As a result, it not only possesses incredible superconductive properties, but is also capable of reflecting gamma rays and resisting forces millions of times larger than traditional baryonic materials.\n\nThis substance owes incredible attributes to its unique composition: higgsino particles (a product of the higgsino field, the supersymmetric partner of the higgs field) bound together with heavy, positively charged particles - often protons - in a repeating lattice.\n\nConsequently, there exists between these above-mentioned particles electrostatic forces of strengths exceeding that of even strong force bonds.§!

 ukn_condensics_lower_case:0 "condensics"
 ukn_condensics_desc:0 "§EWhile normal particle-antiparticle pairs quickly annihilate, magnetic "north" or N-monopoles and magnetic "south" or S-monopoles, due to asymmetries in the higgs field, do not annihilate while possessing energy levels below the electroweak unification energy threshold.\n\nInstead, these supermassive monopole particles - essentially "knots" in the higgs field - form stable monopolium lattices at high, sub-unification temperatures, while, intruigingly, possessing a bose-einstein condensate-like structure at lower, sub-trillion degree temperatures.\n\nThis remarkable state of monopole matter - colloquially known as §H$ukn_condensics$§! (£ukn_condensics£) - inherits many attributes from classic BECs, but with millionfold speedups in interaction rates.\n\nUniquely, however, $ukn_condensics_lower_case$ are more strongly bonded and have a higher heat capacity than its parent compound, monopolium itself, and, as a result, possesses a density thousands of times and a binding energy millions of times that of quark matter.§!

 ukn_quasi_matter:0 "Quasi-Matter"
 ukn_quasi_matter_lower_case:0 "quasi-matter"
 ukn_quasi_matter_desc:0 "§EAt tremendously high temperatures - only seven orders of magnitude below the planck temperature - if and only if heated in specific, fluctuating ratios, the higgs- and axion fields undergo a process distinct from - yet somewhat similar to - electroweak unification: the two fields become one, forming a non-scalar overfield which exhibits properties of both its progenitors.\n\nKnown as A£ukn_icon_text_exponent_0£H£ukn_icon_text_exponent_0£, its energy state determines the phase offset of all local quantum fields, but also alters its own properties. Specifically, it allows modifying the minimum energy level of its mass-inducing, higgs-field-like component, essentially permitting unrestricted alteration of particle rest mass.\n\nWhile the exhibition of this extraordinary property requires extreme temperatures within the higgs- and axion fields, it does not explicitly require such temeperatures in surrounding, affected particles.\n\nAs such, we are able to create bose-einstein condensate-like materials - commonly known as §H$ukn_quasi_matter$§! (£ukn_quasi_matter£) - possessing truly spectacular properties: expression of nearly any quantum state or system, the formation of macro-scale quantum entities possessing unfathomable resilience to physical stress, causally-limited interaction rates and even precise control of positive spatial geometry via the creation of ultra-dense objects.§!

 ehof_sr_negative_mass:0 "Negative Mass"
 ehof_sr_negative_mass_desc:0 "§E§H$ehof_sr_negative_mass$§! (£ehof_sr_negative_mass£) are an extremely exotic form of matter that defies the known laws of physics by possessing negative mass.\n\nOriginally thought to be impossible to exist, this substance's unique properties create a negative gravitational curvature, anti-gravity so to speak, which has limitless technological potential.§! "
 
 ukn_causalitons:0 "Causalitons"
 ukn_causalitons_desc:0 "§EAfter the dissolution of its event horizon, there remains nothing of a black hole but a wound in spacetime itself: a region of infinite density, a one-dimensional superposition of every quantum state it is composed of, the ringularity.\n\nWhile the existence of such an object should be impossible in normal, causal spacetime, this region of infinite density is, per definition, not bound by causality. Time does not pass - or passes at an infinite rate, in the case of negative spatial curvature - at this gash in spacetime, yet not only can it exist in stability, but interact with its external environment, through ditemporal mechanics.\n\nBy looping positive and negative curvature ringularities around each other - spatially and temporally - their gravitational effects can be made to effectively cancel out, and, as such, their angular momentum (and thus "radius") can be reduced, while avoiding the re-emergence of any event horizons.\n\nIn essence, this allows the creation of "particles" with not only customizable mass and quantum properties, but also interaction cross-sections - or "sizes" - potentially much smaller than the planck length.\n\nBy combining a multitude of these ringularity pairs into complex structures, we are able to create sub-planck scale quantum systems - known as §H$ukn_causalitons$§! (£ukn_causalitons£) - which exhibit a range of properties impossible within "normal" spacetime: limited violation of causality and thermodynamics, creation of closed timelike curves, computation rates far beyond bremermann's limit and perhaps most esoterically, construction of "pocket realities" with potentially altered quantum energy states.§!"
