 sr_dark_matter:0 "Axions"
 sr_dark_matter_lower_case:0 "axions"
 sr_dark_matter_desc:1 "§EBriefly considered (and later dismissed) as a potential "dark matter candidate" by several primitive field theories, the existence of §H$sr_dark_matter$§! (£sr_dark_matter£) and their parent quantum field - albeit not as a form of large "missing mass" - had only been recently confirmed, due to advances in theoretical and instrumental sophistication.\n\n$sr_dark_matter$ form spontaneously in high-gravity environments near causal barriers - in essence, near black hole event horizons - at a rate logarithmically proportional to the strength of gravity near the aforementioned event horizon.\n\nUniquely, the axion field's energy level can only be modified via direct excitation of axion particles, with the result of these energy level changes being a phase offset in all nearby quantum fields. This in turn modifies the properties of certain particles and quantum interactions, such as inducing a dipole magnetic field in neutrons.\n\nWhile certainly having fascinating applications in computing and general materials science, the reality of the axion field hints at the existence of deeper physics which may utterly revolutionize our understanding of the universe.§!"
 
 ehof_sr_negative_mass:0 "Negative Mass"
 ehof_sr_negative_mass_desc:0 "§E§H$ehof_sr_negative_mass$§! (£ehof_sr_negative_mass£) is an extremely exotic form of matter which defies many previously-thought fundamental conservation laws by possessing a non-apparent, non-emergent negative energy potential.\n\nThis substance's unique attributes - negative gravitational curvature, inverse time-dilation and negative kinetic/potential energy states - allow for truly spectacular effects: creation of complex lightspeed wormhole networks, stable spatial compression, regions of time-accelerated spacetime and most absurdly, conservation-law-violating self-perpetuating energy generation.\n\nApplying all these facets - and our understanding of near-planck temperature quantum mechanics - into a single whole, we are able to create objects unlike anything preceding them: interlaced positive-negative mass bose-einstein condensates linked with quectometer-scale wormholes, time-dilated to possess staggering fast interaction rates or barely allow the passage time at all, while being capable of expressing any quantum system and assembling more of itself from nothing at all.\n\nUsage of this above-mentioned hybrid of negative and positive energy potentials permits the construction of arbitrarily large, conjoined structures capable of performing calculations at a rate approaching bremermann's limit while possessing near-boundless resistance to physical stress.§!"
