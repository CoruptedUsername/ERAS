 nanites:0 "Automachines"
 nanites_desc:0 "§E§H$nanites$§! (£nanites£) represent any and potentially all of the following types of microscale actuators:\n\n§WMicro-Machines:§! machines possessing a size on the scale of a ten-thousandth percentile of a meter.\n\n§WNanites:§! non-biological or pseudo-biological machines built on a scale similar to small bacteria.\n\n§WPico-Machines:§! molecular actuators consistenting of only a scant few small atoms in exotic quantum states, their movement significantly influenced by quantum interactions, rather than merely chemical ones.\n\n§WFemto-Actuators:§! machines on the scale of large atomic nuclei, composed of exotic fermionic particulate.\n\n§WAtto-Machines:§! quantum actuators below the scale of nucleons such as protons and neutrons, often conglomerations of exotic subatomic particles in a bose-einstein condensate-like state.§!"
 
 consumer_goods:0 "Articles"
 consumer_goods_desc:2 "§E§H$consumer_goods$§! (£consumer_goods£) are a manufactured resource representing both the equipment integral to the continued function of all advanced planetary- and space structures, and the various supplies needed to perform certain advanced £job£ §HJobs§!, such as £job_researcher£ §HResearch§!.\n\nAdditionally, articles also represent the various gadgets, luxuries and goods necessary to give your £pop£ §HPops§! a good life. We can gain more by:\n§Y1.§! Building £district£ §H$district_industrial_plural$§! on the surface of colonized planets.\n§Y2.§! Building certain £ukn_icon_megastructure£ §HMacro-Constructions§! (§HSpace-Stations§!, §HKilostructures§!, §HMegastructures§! or §HGigatructures§!).\n§Y3.§! Buying more on the §HMarket§!.§!"

 alloys:0 "Polymerics"
 alloys_desc:1 "§E§H$alloys$§! (£alloys£) are advanced materials composed primarily of high tensile strength macromolecular polymer-like structures with a military application, which we need to construct §HShips§! and §HStarbases§!. We can gain more by:\n§Y1.§! Building £district£ §H$district_industrial_plural$§! on the surface of colonized planets.\n§Y2.§! Building certain £ukn_icon_megastructure£ §HMacro-Constructions§!

 volatile_motes:0 "Exotic Particles"
 volatile_motes_desc:0 "§E§H$volatile_motes$§! (£volatile_motes£) represent any and potentially all of the following subatomic particles, usually produced in particle factories:\n\n§WFermionics:§! non-baryonic, non-force carrier particles which cannot - in normal conditions - occupy the same position in spacetime as their peers. Examples include: top-, bottom-, strange- and charm quarks, neutrinos and tauons.\n\n§WBosonics:§! force carrier particles (excluding the photon) which can occupy the same position in spacetime as their peers in nearly all conditions. For example: W-, Z-, and higgs bosons and gluons.\n\n§WAntimatter:§! fermionic particles which annihilate when brought into contact with - and having an opposite charge compared to - their regular counterparts, such as positrons, antiquarks and antineutrinos.\n\n§WS-Particles:§! supersymmetric partners of standard model particles, such as selectrons, s-quarks, photinos and gluinos, as well as composite s-particles such as the "higgsino".§!"
 
 exotic_gases:0 "Exotic Fluids"
 exotic_gases_desc:0 "§E§H$exotic_gases$§! (£exotic_gases£) represent a wide variety substances, ranging from complex gaseous molecules and superfluids, to thought-altering compounds. These unusual materials most often see use in scientific research and the operation of advanced magnetic coils.§!"
 
 rare_crystals:0 "Superconductive Crystals"
 rare_crystals_desc:0 "§E§H$rare_crystals$§! (£rare_crystals£) possess, as their name would suggest, superconductive properties at most temperature ranges while in a non-fluidic state. Their unique structure also makes them extremely effective at focusing laser beams, and, as a result, they are often utilized in advanced electronics both as superconductors and precision photonic transmitters. Additionally, many cultures treasure them as decorations and adornments.§!"
 
 sr_dark_matter:0 "Axions"
 sr_dark_matter_lower_case:0 "axions"
 sr_dark_matter_desc:1 "§EBriefly considered (and later dismissed) as a potential "dark matter candidate" by several primitive field theories, the existence of §H$sr_dark_matter$§! (£sr_dark_matter£) and their parent quantum field - albeit not as a form of large "missing mass" - had only been recently confirmed, due to advances in theoretical and instrumental sophistication.\n\n$sr_dark_matter$ form spontaneously in high-gravity environments near causal barriers - in essence, near black hole event horizons - at a rate logarithmically proportional to the strength of gravity near the aforementioned event horizon.\n\nUniquely, the axion field's energy level can only be modified via direct excitation of axion particles, with the result of these energy level changes being a phase offset in all nearby quantum fields. This in turn modifies the properties of certain particles and quantum interactions, such as inducing a dipole magnetic field in neutrons.\n\nWhile certainly having fascinating applications in computing and general materials science, the reality of the axion field hints at the existence of deeper physics which may utterly revolutionize our understanding of the universe.§!"
